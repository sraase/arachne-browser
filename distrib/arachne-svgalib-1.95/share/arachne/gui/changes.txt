Changes since release 1.71;UE01
-------------------------------

1.89;GPL,386+ stable for DOS
----
Release date: Nov 27, 2005

I must take this time to apologize to Joe da Silva.

v1.87 and now v1.89 include many of his code changes for which I did not even
mention that the credit must go to him. 

His hard work and dedication are what made v1.87 (and now v1.89), possible.

Without Joe's code, there would have been nothing more than the very
superficial changes that I made.

My apologies to Joe, to the rest of the members of the Arachne
development team and to all Arachne users for not saying this sooner.

The following is a list of Joe's changes.
---------

1.73J2 :
* Minor XSWAP optimization for low-end CPU's.
* Comment bug fixes & additions in 'inetstr.c' & 'ie_bin.c'.

1.73J3 :
* Extensive changes for improved stability & safety
  (buffer overrun vulnerabilities and the like).

1.73J4 :
* Full-size cookie support (half size if memory is low),
  including safety check for old format cookie file.
(note from glennmcc:
 IMO, Joe's full-size/half-size cookie code is some of
 the best work I have ever seen)
* Optimization of memory usage (saved about 5K, despite
  the full-size cookie support).

1.77J1 :
* Fixed Borland's "ctype.h" bugs, with help from MHT,
  and added a check in 'posix.h' to ensure the updated
  "ctype.h" was being used.
(note from glennmcc: posix.h not in v1.87... but is in v1.89)

1.83J1 :
* Esc key enhancement (final version) which, if you
  use the "Esc key = previous page" option, allows
  you to also use the Esc key to stop a web page loading,
  similar to the "X" button, otherwise it performs the
  go-back function.
* Emergency Exit feature (enabled via AltKeys option
  keyword, which supersedes the AltTab keyword) which
  allows you to terminate Arachne if stuck in an infinite
  loop but aren't actually locked-up, using the key
  sequence Ctrl-Alt-Esc. For safety reasons, the
  "emergency exit" request is ignored if DOS indicates
  it is busy, in which case it may be necessary to issue
  the key sequence again.
* Provision for adding image/icon web page hyperlinks to
  the hotlist, not just textural web page hyperlinks.
  Right-clicking an image will still display this on a
  page by itself, but if this had an associated hyperlink,
  "You can add selected link to Hotlist" will be displayed
  on the status line. If you actually wanted to add the
  URL of the image to your hotlist instead, just right-
  -click again, then you can.
(note: feature only partially implemented in 1.87/1.89)
* Added persistence feature for the "You can add selected
  link to Hotlist" status message, so you are reminded when
  you have a link available to add to the hotlist.
* Re-enabled "httpstub" feature for operation as Windoze
  client (ala 1.83 code, but with additional code re-enabled,
  experimental).
(note from glennmcc: I have not tested this one as-of-yet)
* Fixed nasty little PrintScreen interrupt vector bug.
* Fixed numerous minor bugs in 'arachne.cfg' parsing.
* An explicit "abnormal" error exit code, to distinguish
  this from an inadvertent exit (for improved bug tracking).
* Replaced many literal constants with macro identifiers
  for improved code clarity, particularly in the GUI code.

1.85J1 :
* Eight-fold increase of the number of JPG/PNG images
  that can be displayed on a web page. Arachne is supposed
  to support web pages with up to 255 images, yet although
  previous versions took the time and trouble to download
  them all, they were unable to display but a fraction of
  this, particularly if the Arachne and Temporary directories
  had long path names.

glennmcc changes in this version.......

Nov 18, 2005
Mime.cfg lines will now retain case sensitivity.
(previous versions converted to all lowercase)

Nov 22, 2005
The auto-load the CSS files did not work correctly
therefore it has been removed.
My undocumented experiment to auto-clear Xswap memory
also did not work correctly and has been removed as-well.

Nov 22, 2005
Modified insight.exe and wwwman.exe to display this message...
(now being maintained by the Arachne Development team)
Also a couple of small aesthetic changes to insight.
_______________________________________________________________________________

----
Release date: Oct 30, 2005 (updated on Nov 02 and Nov 11, 2005)
(8th GPL version released since the release of v1.71;UE01 in Aug of 2002)

Aug 20, 2005
'Cleaned-up' the download progress indicator
and made the bytes/sec indicator optional.

appended to files attached to emails.

Sep 27, 2005
Modified Insight.exe so that 'finger', 'gopher', 'https' and 'telnet'
will now be 'clickable links' in displayed email messages.
(previous versions only did this for 'http', 'ftp' and email addresses)

Sep 27, 2005
'Melded' into my code, these advancements made by Joe da Silva
* Added "ShortestRefresh" option (default = 2 sec)
* Fixed the useless "Local IP  0.0.0.0" info. display

Sep 29, 2005
Small mod to the SPAM freeze-up stopper code.
(old code was causing some undesirable aborted pop3 downloads)

Sep 30, 2005
Moved 'Up one level' feature to URL instead of the Arachne version number.

Oct 09, 2005
Added the new hotkey Alt+V to 'validate'
the current page via http://validator.w3.org/

Oct 16, 2005
Added the ability to request a return receipt from email clients
capable of returning them.
'Return-Receipt-To:' and 'Disposition-Notification-To:' will now be placed
into the headers of outgoing mail messages for which we choose to do so.

Oct 18, 2005
Small modification to insight.exe so that it will also recognize
'User-Agent:' in addition to the "standard" 'X-Mailer:'

Oct 19, 2005
Arachne will now check disk space on the 'mail drive' instead of the
'current drive' for sufficient space to save incoming mail messages.
If available space is too low for a particular message, that fact will
be written into a .CNM in our inbox.
--- example ---
Subject: Skipping message #1, too big for disk space available

 Available disk space on mail drive: 294912
 Required disk space for this message: 1212994
----------------

Oct 25, 2005
Changing video settings via hgcgevga.htm will now leave the screen layout
the way it was before the change was made instead of resetting to the
default layout of 2 bars across the top of the screen.

Oct. 25, 2005
Thanks to Vladimir, one of our newest development team members.
Insight.exe now has 'multi-lingual' capability.
Both English and Russian compiles are now available.

Oct 29, 2005
We can now choose whether or not to display HTML backgrounds
with this new selection on the 'Preferences & Performance' setup page.
_ Display HTML background images 

Nov 02, 2005
Now the stylesheet will automatically load when we have CSS enabled but
autoload of images disabled.
No more need for loading all of the images just to get the stylesheet
we need to get CSS to work correctly.

Nov 11, 2005
Two bug fixes... re-uploaded package.

Jul 27, 2005 
Thanks go to 'un-named SRC' for an alternate 'cross cursor'.

1.83;GPL,386+ stable for DOS
----
Release date: Mar 06, 2005

Feb 17, 2005
Crashes due to attempting to use the '+' key to increase resolution to a
level that is too high for your video card to handle should now be eliminated.
The initial video setup will now set the variable 'MaxRes' in arachne.cfg
The fresh compile of core.exe (Feb 17, 2005), will not go higher than 'MaxRes'
when the '+' key is pressed. 1==640x480, 2==800x600, 3==1024x768
(crashes will still occur if a "MaxRes" setting is chosen
 on the setup screen which your card can't handle)

Thanks to Glenn Gilbreath (aka Wizzy),
A bug in the <SELECT> tag has been squashed.

Feb 27, 2005
The 'Mail2Hist feature' caused more problems than it solved.
Therefore, all code pertaining to it has been removed.

Ray Andrews and I are prodding each other along.
We refined my Jan 26 fix of the left/right frames
CSS linkhover bug so that it works even better.
And we have the top/bottom bug almost fixed.
(works 90% correctly)
Mar 05, 2005
Ray finished fixing this bug. It is now 100% dead. :)

Mar 05, 2005
Fixed one more small problem in CSS
Linkhover will no longer default to black. Instead it will now use
a contrasting color from both inactive link color and page BGcolor.

Wwwman.exe will now handle directory listings of 1536 items.
(old limit was 1024 items)
Also, it will no-longer lockup or crash when there are more items
than the limit. When a dir listing is attempted on a dir containing
more than 1536 items, those first 1536 will be shown.

Jan 13, 2005
Small change to insight.exe
selected.dat will no longer be changed when the archive button is used.

Implemented a combination of my Mail2Hist options
working along with Ray's goback() alterations.

Feb 03, 2005
Linking to the Arachne version number at the top of the screen will
now take us 'Up one level' when we are viewing a remote file.
(will still go to 'about.htm' if we are currently local)

Feb 06, 2005 
Fixed another long-standing bug in which all links on a page were 'dead' 
after doing a Cntrl+Enter 'background download' of one of those links. 

Feb 11, 2005
Thanks to Andrej Cuckov we now have our option of 3 different cursors.
The original 'Hand', an 'Arrow' courtesy of Andrej and a 'Cross'

Fixed 'stuck pointer' and pointer colors.
(thank you Ray)

1.79;GPL,386+ stable for DOS
----
Release date: Dec 25, 2004

Oct 17, 2004
Re-enabled HTTPSTUB which allows Arachne to use the Windows DUN
instead of a DOS packet driver. This makes it possible to run
Arachne on machines which have WinModems which simply refuse to
work with a DOS packet driver.
Thanks to Glenn Gilbreath (aka Wizzy), for making this suggestion.

Oct. 26, 2004
Fixed my mistakes from v1.77 in which I had not included all of
the new cookie code written by Joe da Silva.

Joe,
Thank you very much for all of the help you gave me in fixing this.
(and for not biting my head off)<g>

Nov 10/11, 2004
Changed the numeric file naming convention for received emails
from decimal format to hexadecimal format beginning at Annnnnnn.CNM
This will prevent old saved emails from being overwritten by new ones
with the same filename.
The DEC format resets to all zeros every 3yrs 2mo.
HEX format beginning at Annnnnnn.CNM gives us over 50 yrs.
(many thanks to L.D. Best for suggesting this one and for all the help
 she gave during its implementation)

Nov 17, 2004
Added bytes/sec download rate to the progress indicator.

Nov 23, 2004
Added 'time remaining' to the download progress indicator.

Dec 19, 2004
Changed the default setting of RightMouseGoesBack to 'Yes'
(it will now be the same as before but can be disabled with 'No')
[note: disabling RtMsGB also disables Shft+Enter for going back]

Dec 22, 2004

To goback or not to goback... _that_ is the question. ;-)

At the suggestion of Greg Mayman.......

We now have the option to either 'goback' or not
when we 'rightclick' the mouse on the body of a page.
(when not over a link, a graphic or a frame)

Jun 02, 2004
Incorporated the completely new cookie handling routines written by Joe da Silva
(we can now handle cookies 4096 bytes in size)

Jun 02, 2004
Compiled CORE.EXE for 386+ processors.
386+ will now be 'the standard' for this and all future releases.
(286- compile available upon request)

Jun 26, 2004
Insight.exe v3.85.5 re-compiled to include this fix.....

---- in base64.c ----
   flushdecoder(fo);
   fclose(fi);

Recompiled Insight.exe for 386+ CPUs (other optimizations as-well) 
Michal, Thank you for that suggestion.

July 25, 2004
Recompiled wwwman.exe (a few small changes and optimizations)

Sep 06, 2004
At the suggestion of Sam Ewalt, the default 'homepage' in the distribution

It will now be Michael Poláks new page... http://arachne.cz/

Sep 17, 2004
