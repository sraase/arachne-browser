SUMMARY:

	PLANY input_file [-r speed] [-s] [-u] [-i irq] [-p port] [-d chan] [-v]

	input_file: Sound file name. Required
	-r:    set output rate (samples/sec)

DESCRIPTION:

	PLANY will play any sound file through the SoundBlaster.
	Currently supported sound types:

		SoundBlaster .VOC
		Sun/NeXT/DEC .AU
		Windows .WAV
		Sounder/Soundtools .SND
		Amiga .8SVX  .IFF

	In addition, PLANY will attempt to detect and play the sound 
	samples contained in Amiga .MOD files.

	If PLANY is unable to identify the header of the sound file,
	it will default to 'unsigned' and '11000 samples/sec', unless
	changed by command line options.

	Press any key during playback to terminate output.


SELF PLAYING SOUND FILES:

	To make an 'executable' sound file, append the sound file to
	the end of PLANY.EXE.  For example:

		COPY/B  PLANY.EXE+SOUND.SND  SOUND.EXE

	will create 'SOUND.EXE' which will play 'SOUND.SND' when executed.
	Note that the '/B' switch on the COPY command is required.
