	LOPIF Graphics Library - Revision History
	-----------------------------------------

990610 : Michael Polak (Arachne Labs) - Original code, released under
         the GNU General Public License.

040612 : Michal H. Tyc - Update of 'zbitbyte.asm', correcting
         the code segment assigned by the linker, performing some
         optimizations and fully commenting the source code.

041017 : Joe da Silva - Revision of 'vesa.h', 'x_mod.c', 'xh_putpx.asm',
         'xh_getpx.asm', 'wrt_vide.asm', 'x_putpix.asm', 'x_getpix.asm',
         'rea_w256.asm', 'x_bar256.asm', 'xh_wrchr.asm', 'xh_write.asm',
         'xh_barx.asm', 'xh_read.asm' and 'wrt_chr.asm', such that the
         VESA bytes/line value is used when available. This corrects a
         compatibility problem with the Matrox Millenium II AGP video
         card in 800x600 modes (and potentially other graphics cards in
         certain SVGA modes). Minor improvements in error handling were
         also made in a couple of places. Minor improvements were also
         made to the 'vv.cc' test application code.
